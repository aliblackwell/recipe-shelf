## Sourdough croissants
This recipe is from a team breakfast at ustwo where I made sourdough croissants. It was an enormous multi-day affair and one I'd love to try again. They did not come out that flaky, but they were delicious.

## Base formula
- 250g dough makes 8 croissants
- 275g = 100%
- 50g starter
- 250g flour
- Liquid = 55% milk and water
- Sugar = 8%
- Salt = 2%
- Butter in dough = 5%
- Butter for lamination = 25%

## Croissant plan
- 275g made eight small croissants at 8cm
- Suggest increasing to 12cm for bigger croissants
- x1.5 = 412.5
- x4 = 1650

## Sunday morning
Standard starter:
- 100g flour
- 100g water

## Sunday late morning
Levain at 30% of 1650 = 500g:
- 200g starter
- 150g water
- 150g flour

## Sunday evening mix (1650 total dough)
- 500g levain
- 1400g flour
- 907g liquid at 55%
- 453.5g milk
- 203.5g water
- 132g sugar
- 33g salt
